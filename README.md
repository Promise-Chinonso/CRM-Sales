# CRM Sales Opportunity
As a BI Developer for MavenTech, a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform. In an effort to become a data-driven organization, I created an interactive dashboard that enables sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance.

# Analysis
### Data Modeling
A star schema was created to ensure effective relationship between the different tables necessary for analysis.

### Quarterly Sales Performance
As compared to the east and west regions, the central regions headed by Dustin and Melvin saw an exponential revenue increase in Q3. Analysis into what was done by these managers to understand the revenue growth is recommended. Note: You need to interact with the dashboard to see this difference in revenue growth by quarter.
