# CRM Sales Opportunity
As a BI Developer for MavenTech, a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They've been using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform. In an effort to become a data-driven organization, I created an interactive dashboard that enables sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance.
